              Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of
              Indian subcontinent. It can be compared to mixing a curry, later
              combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is
              especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as
              among its diaspora. Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins
