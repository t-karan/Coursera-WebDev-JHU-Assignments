              <h3>Chicken Biryani</h3>
            </div>
            <p>
              Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of
              Indian subcontinent. It can be compared to mixing a curry, later
              combining it with semi-cooked rice separately. This dish is
              especially popular throughout the Indian subcontinent, as well as
              among its diaspora.

            <p>
              According to the American Cancer Society, PAHs form when fat from
              meat drips onto the charcoal. They then rise with the smoke and
              can get deposited on the food. ... The hotter the temperature and
              the longer the meat cooks, the more HCAs are formed.
